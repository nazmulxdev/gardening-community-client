### **Project Overview**

The primary goal of Green Circle is to build a supportive and interactive platform where users can share their gardening knowledge, showcase their work, and learn from others. The site features a dynamic "trending tips" section, user profiles for active gardeners, and a comprehensive resource hub for all gardening needs.

### **Key Features**

✅ **Dual Theme:** The website supports both light and dark themes for a comfortable user experience.

✅ **Dynamic Page Titles:** Every page has a unique title that updates in the browser tab for better navigation and SEO.

✅ **Post Reactions:** Logged-in users can "love" react to posts, which contributes to the trending algorithm.

✅ **Trending Tips Section:** The homepage dynamically showcases the most popular tips based on the number of "love" reactions.

✅ **Active Gardener Profiles:** The "Feature Gardeners" section highlights users with an "active" status, while the "Explore Gardeners" page allows browsing all users.

✅ **Tip Management:** Users can share their own public or hidden gardening tips on the "Share Gardeners Tips" page and manage them in the "My Tips" section.

✅ **Conditional Content:** While all users can see public tips, only logged-in users can view the full details of a tip.
